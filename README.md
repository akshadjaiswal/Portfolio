# 👋 Hi, I'm Akshad Jaiswal

**I ship meaningful things daily** 🙋🏻

**Full-stack engineer** who enjoys working end-to-end: product discovery, fast prototypes, scalable backends, and polished UX.

Currently founding SDE at a startup while freelancing on the side. I juggle delivery speed, reliability and cost every day. My philosophy? **Keep things simple: ship small, learn fast, iterate with real user feedback.**

## What's This?

My personal portfolio built with Next.js. Projects auto-sync from GitHub because manually updating portfolios is so 2015.

**Live:** [akshad-work.vercel.app](https://akshad-work.vercel.app) 

## The Fun Stuff

- Building things that actually work (and work well)
- India-based, globally-minded
- Believes good code is simple code
- Cal.com evangelist (because async > meetings)

## Tech Stack

Built with the good stuff:

- **Next.js 16** - App Router, because I like living on the edge
- **TypeScript** - For when JavaScript gets too wild
- **Tailwind CSS** - Utility-first is the way
- **React Query** - Smart data fetching
- **Framer Motion** - Smooth animations
- **GitHub API** - Projects fetch themselves

## Quick Start

```bash
# Clone and install
git clone https://github.com/akshadjaiswal/Portfolio.git
